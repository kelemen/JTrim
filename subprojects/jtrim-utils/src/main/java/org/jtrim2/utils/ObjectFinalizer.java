/**
 * Defines a simple safety-net for objects managing unmanaged resources (e.g.:
 * files).
 * <P>
 * {@code ObjectFinalizer} takes a {@link Runnable} in its constructor and
 * allows it to be called in the {@link #doFinalize() doFinalize()} method.
 * Also, {@code ObjectFinalizer} declares a {@link Object#finalize() finalizer},
 * in which it will call {@code run()} method of the specified {@code Runnable}
 * if it was not called manually (by calling {@code doFinalize()}).
 * <P>
 * Once the {@code doFinalize()} method of an {@code ObjectFinalizer} was called
 * it will no longer retain a reference to the {@code Runnable} specified at
 * construction time.
 * <P>
 * See the following example code using {@code ObjectFinalizer}:
 * <pre>{@code
 * class UnmanagedResourceHolder implements Closable {
 *   privata final ObjectFinalizer finalizer;
 *
 *   // Other declarations ...
 *
 *   public UnmanagedResourceHolder() {
 *     // Initialization code ...
 *
 *     this.finalizer = new ObjectFinalizer(this::doCleanup, "UnmanagedResourceHolder.cleanup");
 *   }
 *
 *   // Other code ...
 *
 *   private void doCleanup() {
 *     // cleanup unmanaged resources
 *   }
 *
 *   {@literal @Override}
 *   public void close() {
 *     finalizer.doFinalize();
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * <P>
 * Assume, that in the above code an {@code UnmanagedResourceHolder} instance
 * becomes unreachable and as such is eligible for garbage collection. Notice
 * that in this case {@code finalizer} also becomes unreachable and such also
 * eligible for garbage collection. Also assume that the {@code close()} method
 * was not called. In this case when the JVM decides to cleanup the now
 * unreachable {@code finalizer} instance, it will call its finalizer and in
 * turn invoke the {@code doCleanup()} method releasing the unmanaged resources.
 *
 * <h3>Unmanaged Resources</h3>
 * In Java a garbage collector is employed, so the programmer is relieved from
 * the burden (mostly) of manual memory management. However, the garbage
 * collector cannot handle anything beyond the memory allocated for objects, so
 * other unmanaged resources require a cleanup method. Although there are
 * {@link Object#finalize() finalizers} in Java, they are unreliable and the
 * only correct solution is the use of a cleanup method. Generally, objects
 * managing unmanaged resources should implement the {@link AutoCloseable}
 * interface.
 * <P>
 * Notice however, that a bug may prevent the program to call the cleanup
 * method of an object, causing the leakage of unmanaged resource, possibly
 * leading to resource exhaustion. In this case finalizers can be useful to
 * provide a safety-net, that even in the case of such previously mentioned bug,
 * a finalizer can be implemented to do the cleanup, so when the JVM actually
 * removes the object, it may cleanup the unmanaged resources.
 *
 * <h3>Benefits of {@code ObjectFinalizer}</h3>
 * One may ask what are the benefits of using {@code ObjectFinalizer} instead of
 * directly declaring a finalizer. There are actually three main benefits of
 * using {@code ObjectFinalizer}:
 * <P>
 * There is a penalty for declaring a {@code finalize()} method in a class: Such
 * objects are slower to be created and will be garbage collected later. There
 * is nothing to be done about slower object creation but the use of
 * {@code ObjectFinalizer} will help with the slower garbage collection.
 * It is assumed that the common case is that the {@code doFinalize()} method is
 * called from the code correctly without relying on the object finalizer
 * (ideally this should always be the case). In this case once the
 * {@code doFinalize()} method was called, the {@code ObjectFinalizer} will
 * store no reference to the object it cleaned up, allowing this object to be
 * garbage collected. Note that the {@code ObjectFinalizer} instance will still
 * suffer from the slower garbage collection but an {@code ObjectFinalizer}
 * whose {@code doFinalize()} method was called is relatively cheap in terms of
 * retained memory. So this can be a considerable benefit if the object
 * protected by the {@code ObjectFinalizer} retains considerable amount of
 * memory.
 * <P>
 * Notice that the {@code run()} method of the specified {@code Runnable}
 * instance can only be called at most once even if the {@code doFinalize()}
 * method is called concurrently multiple times. This effectively makes the
 * cleanup method idempotent for free which makes the cleanup method safer.
 * <P>
 * In case the cleanup method was failed to be called, the
 * {@code ObjectFinalizer} will log this failure when it detects in its
 * finalizer, that the {@code doFinalize()} method was not called. So this error
 * will be documented in the logs and can be analyzed later.
 *
 * <h3>Thread safety</h3>
 * This class is safe to be used by multiple threads concurrently.
 *
 * <h4>Synchronization transparency</h4>
 * Unless otherwise noted, methods of this class are not
 * <I>synchronization transparent</I>.
